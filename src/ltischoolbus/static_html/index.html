      <h1>Welcome to the<br>LTI-to-SchoolBus Bridge</h1>

      <p class="note">
	Note: use of this service is via <b>POST</b> to

      <br>
      LTI-to-SchoolBus bridges are servers that connect Learning Technology
      Interchange (LTI) consumers with a SchoolBus (see figure).
      <p>

      <br>
      Each bridge listens on a dedicated port. LTI consumers may execute
      any of three actions by POSTing an HTTP request to the bridge. Options
      are<br>
      <ul>
	<li>Publish to a SchoolBus topic</li>
	<li>Subscribe to a SchoolBus topic</li>
	<li>Unsubscribe from a SchoolBus topic</li>
      </ul>
      The figure shows examples of a request as it should appear in the POST
      body. If LTI consumers subscribe to a topic, they need to provide a
      URL to which the bridge will POST messages coming from the bus.
      The figure shows an example of what to expect from such a message
      delivery in the POST body.
